  <span class="block title">Hi! I'm AJ Troxell, welcome to my website.</span>
  <h2 class="subheading">Father, graphic designer, web developer, accessibility hero, and technology geek.</h2>
  <p>Growing up, I was torn between wanting to be a comedian or an entomologist. My curiosity was endless, whether it was keeping a black widow spider in a jar under my bed or taking apart my dad's computer. Those interests may seem unrelated, but they all have something in common, a fascination with discovery and problem-solving.</p>
  <p>That curiosity eventually led me to web development. What began as tinkering with HTML and learning through trial and error turned into a lifelong passion for technology. Today, I work on internal products at <a href="https://bunn.com" target="_blank">BUNN</a>, pushing the technological boundaries of the coffee service industry, while also running my own tech service company, <a href="https://atomtech.com" target="_blank">AtomTech</a>. I'm always building, learning, and evolving in the ever-changing world of tech.</p>
